# Contribute to Microsoft FastTrack

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Microsoft FastTrack's open source program! This article outlines the guidance you should follow to ensure we can accept your contribution. If you have any questions please open an issue so we help get things sorted.

## All Contributions

The details in this section apply to all contributions.

* Create a branch for you contributions, we will not accept contributions from a MASTER branch [How-To](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository/) | [Why](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)
* Before sending a pull request, please sync/update your branch with our master HEAD
* Contributions MUST NOT contain any PII, company specific information, or other private details
* Contributions MUST NOT contain any software, references, dependencies, or "copied" code that would break our [license](LICENSE)
* Each PR should contain one thing - a bug fix, new script, new sample, etc

## New Samples & Scripts

* Include sufficient detail so we can understand what is being added by completing the PR template
* Scripts and Samples MUST include a README.md that describes the contents and how to install/run, see the [template](TEMPLATE-README.md) to get started
* Scripts should be added in their own folder to the scripts folder
* Samples should be added in their own folder to the samples folder
* For large samples or scripts please open an issue before you start to discuss so we can ensure your work is appropriate before you invest the time
* Folder names should be "slug cased" (ex: my-cool-script) and be descriptive but not overly long

## New Tools

* Tools are defined as applications or "something" more than a script. Usually they are compiled and have releases
* Tools generally go into their own repo, which we need to create. Please open an issue to discuss adding a new tool

## Bug Fixes

* Please complete the issue template and describe the bug you are fixing with enough detail we can test your change
* If you find a bug, please open an issue first and mention you are working on a fix so we avoid duplicating work
